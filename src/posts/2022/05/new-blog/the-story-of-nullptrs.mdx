My adventures in blogging began in 2007 at the age of eight. In typical veritas fashion, 
my first blog post reads:

> If i made a promise sorrry i was out sick but anyways ill be posting now

My first ever blog post was an ode to procrastination and ADHD. Knowing I had zero readers 
at the time, I still felt an obligation to create the best Club Penguin guides an eight year 
old could possibly provide. All from the comfort of my shared living room computer.

And that I did. Well... sort of. My first guide detailed how to "exploit" the game in order 
to allow your avatar use special item animations without the item appearing equipped. 
(i.e. penguins with guitars equipped would be shown strumming their guitar when playing the dancing animation)

The title, bold and proud, "dance without the clothes". Uh... Cut me some slack, I was eight! The content wasn't 
any better. Void of any punctuation, images, capitalization, and structure, the guide goes as follows:

> first open the player card then put ur gutiar on dont put anything else on close the player card open the player 
card take off the guitar dont close the player card then put on the tour guide hat still dont close the player card 
now dance. done

As terrible as this post was, it motivated me to write my next groundbreaking guide. Published on Jun 29, 2007, 
this guide teaches the reader how to glitch their penguin to equip two instruments at once 
(The game would normally remove one instrument when trying to equip another). The title you ask? 
"Under Construction!!!!!!!! 2 Things At One (not hacking)". Yep, the blog was definitely under construction a
lright. The one cool thing about this particular post is that it included images this time! The guide:

> First open ur player card the put only ur guitar.After Close the player card.AfterWards open u player card again 
then take of the guitar and put the drum sticks on (DONT CLOSE UR PLAYER CARD) now dance note:THIS WORKS WITH ANY 
ANIMATION ITEM

Crossed out text indicated that this method was now patched. This post was a step up from my first two and I didn't 
stop there. A few more posts followed, up until Nov 30, 2008, with a post titled:

# Appoligies

> Sorry people i havent been posting in days So sorry i keep my promise i will start posting from now on On the 
bright side i joined a production owned by Mr artic 1 and is called bpp productions here are the updates on clubpenguin.

The blog comes full circle with an apology reminiscient of my first ever post. I mention joining a production. 
A term used to describe a group of friends who recorded, edited, and produced Club Penguin music videos. 
A video production team. Very impressive considering we were all younger than ten at this time. Below is a 
Club Penguin music video for Cascada's Evacuate the Dancefloor that I am featured in.
